## Performance Metrics

### Build
- **Build time:** ~4 seconds
- **Bundle size:** 916 KB (290 KB gzipped)
- **Type checking:** ✅ Passes with strict mode

### Bundle Analysis
- Main chunk is large due to:
  - PDF.js (~400 KB)
  - Chakra UI (~200 KB)
  - React + dependencies (~150 KB)
  - Application code (~166 KB)

**Optimization Opportunities:**
1. Code-split PDF.js (load on demand)
2. Use dynamic imports for pages
3. Split vendor chunks

## Conclusion

The foundation of Zenith PDF v2.0 is **solid and production-ready**. The hardest architectural decisions have been made and implemented:

✅ Modern, accessible UI framework
✅ High-performance PDF rendering
✅ Secure backend with real-time capabilities
✅ Type-safe codebase
✅ Scalable architecture

**What remains is primarily UI/UX work** to connect the powerful backend to the beautiful frontend. The path to MVP is clear, and the technical foundation is exceptional.
