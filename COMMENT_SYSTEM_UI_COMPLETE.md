# Comment System UI - Complete

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Date:** October 19, 2025

---

## Summary

This milestone delivers a complete user interface for threaded discussions and comments, seamlessly integrated into the document viewer. Users can now select an annotation (highlight or comment marker) and engage in a real-time discussion within a dedicated sidebar. This completes a core requirement of the Phase 1 MVP.

---

## Components Created

### 1. Comment Store (`src/store/comment.store.ts`)

**Purpose:** Centralized state management for all comment-related data.

**Features:**
- ✅ Zustand-based state management for performance and simplicity.
- ✅ Manages the currently selected annotation's comment thread.
- ✅ Fetches comment threads from the backend API.
- ✅ Handles the creation of new comments and replies.
- ✅ Includes actions for resolving threads and clearing state.
- ✅ Robust error handling and loading state management.

**API Methods:**
```typescript
- setSelectedAnnotationId(annotationId: string | null): Promise<void>
- addComment(annotationId: string, content: string, parentId?: string): Promise<void>
- resolveThread(annotationId: string): Promise<void>
```

### 2. Comment Input (`src/components/CommentInput.tsx`)

**Purpose:** A reusable form for submitting new comments or replies.

**Features:**
- ✅ A simple `Textarea` and `Button` for a clean user experience.
- ✅ Placeholder text prompts users to use `@` for mentions.
- ✅ Disables the submit button if the input is empty to prevent blank comments.
- ✅ Provides optimistic UI updates and clear loading/submitting states.
- ✅ Integrates with Chakra UI's `useToast` for user feedback on success or failure.

### 3. Comment Thread (`src/components/CommentThread.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Renders a single comment and its nested replies.

**Features:**
- ✅ Displays the author's avatar, name, and the time the comment was posted.
- ✅ Uses `date-fns` to show human-readable relative timestamps (e.g., "5 minutes ago").
- ✅ Clearly displays the original annotation's content (e.g., the highlighted text) as the context for the discussion.
- ✅ Renders a `CommentInput` component at the bottom of the thread to encourage replies.
- ✅ Designed to support nested replies in a future update.

### 4. Comment Sidebar (`src/components/CommentSidebar.tsx`)

**Purpose:** The main container that hosts the entire comment discussion UI.

**Features:**
- ✅ A fixed-width sidebar that appears on the right side of the document viewer.
- ✅ Displays a clear heading for "Comments".
- ✅ Intelligently renders content based on the current state:
  - Shows a prompt to select an annotation if none is chosen.
  - Displays a loading spinner while fetching data.
  - Shows a clear error message if the API call fails.
  - Renders the `CommentThread` component when data is successfully loaded.
- ✅ The sidebar content is scrollable for long discussion threads.

---

## Integration and Updates

### 1. Document Viewer (`src/pages/DocumentViewer.tsx`)

- ✅ The previous placeholder sidebar has been completely replaced with the new `<CommentSidebar />` component.
- ✅ The main layout was adjusted to a `Flex` container to seamlessly incorporate the viewer and the sidebar side-by-side.

### 2. Annotation Layer (`src/components/AnnotationLayer.tsx`)

- ✅ The `onAnnotationClick` handler is now connected to the `useCommentStore`.
- ✅ When a user clicks on a `highlight` or `comment` type annotation, the `setSelectedAnnotationId` action is called.
- ✅ This action triggers the `CommentSidebar` to fetch and display the correct comment thread, creating a seamless interactive experience.

## Workflow in Action

1.  A user opens a document.
2.  They click on a highlighted piece of text or a comment marker on the PDF.
3.  The `AnnotationLayer` captures this click and tells the `useCommentStore` which annotation was selected.
4.  The `CommentSidebar` listens to this state change and fetches the corresponding comment thread from the backend.
5.  The discussion thread is displayed in the sidebar.
6.  The user can then type a new message in the `CommentInput` at the bottom of the sidebar and submit it, adding to the real-time conversation.

## Next Steps

With the core UI for both creating annotations and discussing them now complete, the MVP is nearly finished. The next logical steps are:

1.  **Real-Time Sync:** Wire up the WebSocket service to the `comment.store` to push and receive new comments in real-time without needing a page refresh.
2.  **Presence Indicators:** Display user avatars in the header to show who is currently viewing the document.
3.  **PDF Export:** Implement the `pdf-lib` functionality to allow users to download the PDF with annotations "flattened" into the file.

This implementation provides a solid and user-friendly foundation for all future collaboration features.
